<h2>💡About Me:</h2>
<b> I have a GPA of 3.5/4.0. Hobbies include playing sports like Tennis, PickleBall, and Basketball, playing the Wii, and going to the gym. </b> 

<b>The reason for creating these github respositories is to demonstrate my ability to use Python and software to display information, organize data, and solve problems. Also some fun/cool projects like the Maze Navigator where I used the BFS algorithm to find the optimal path of any maze grid. </b>

<b>I am a passionate young leader looking for a place where my creativity and curiosity can blossom. The industries I am interested in are Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Networking, Finance. I will continue to add more and more projects to my portfolio as I contnue my journey as an ISE engineer and show what I can do. </b>
